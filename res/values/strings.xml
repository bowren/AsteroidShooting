    <string name="description">The objective of Asteroids is to shoot as many asteroids as you can without losing three ships. If you are using touchscreen controls, the red button is for firing, and the joystick is for turnning and thrusting around. If you are using the keyboard you can set your controls, the defaults are A turn left, D turn right, W thrust forward, S thrust backward, and Space for fire. The points per asteroid vary on size:</string>
    <string name="onepoint">1 Point</string>
    <string name="twopoint">2 Points</string>
    <string name="threepoint">3 Points</string>
